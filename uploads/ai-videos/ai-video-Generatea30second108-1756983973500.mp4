This is a placeholder video for: Generate a 30-second, 1080p, 16:9 aspect ratio cartoon video in the style of classic Looney Tunes, specifically mimicking the animation style of Bob Clampett.  The video features a hyperactive, anthropomorphic squirrel named "Squeaky" with oversized eyes and a perpetually mischievous grin, attempting to pilfer acorns from Barnaby Badger's meticulously organized acorn hoard, depicted within a detailed, whimsical burrow featuring hand-painted textures and earthy color palettes. Squeaky employs slapstick humor and inventive, Rube Goldberg-esque contraptions—including a miniature catapult powered by a slingshot and a system of pulleys and levers—to reach the acorns. Barnaby is a stout, grumpy badger with exaggerated facial expressions and a thick, bristly coat, rendered with bold outlines and cel-shading.  Use vibrant, saturated colors with a limited palette emphasizing yellows, browns, and blues. Exaggerated character designs and expressive animation are crucial, utilizing squash and stretch techniques. The animation style should be fast-paced with clear, clean lines and distinct character poses.  Include a playful, upbeat ragtime soundtrack with comedic sting sound effects perfectly synchronized with the slapstick action. The final scene should feature a humorous, unexpected twist: Barnaby, seemingly outsmarted, reveals a hidden, much larger acorn stash, leaving Squeaky stunned but ultimately triumphant with a single, perfectly sized acorn. The overall style should evoke a sense of timeless cartoon charm, with clean, bright visuals and comedic pacing.
