fix: permanent scheduler schema fix - resolves content_type column error

PROBLEM:
Application fails to start with error:
"PostgresError: column content_type does not exist"

ROOT CAUSE:
Database schema drift between migrations and production database.
The content table was missing critical columns required by the
scheduler service to function.

SOLUTION:
1. Created comprehensive schema repair script
2. Added migration 0031 with idempotent column additions
3. Enhanced scheduler service with pre-flight schema validation
4. Added verification script for testing
5. Included detailed documentation

CHANGES:
- Added fix-scheduler-schema-permanent.cjs (automated repair)
- Added migrations/0031_fix_scheduler_schema_permanent.sql
- Updated server/services/scheduler.ts (added validation)
- Added verify-scheduler-schema-fix.cjs (testing)
- Added comprehensive documentation (4 files)
- Added deployment script (PowerShell)

COLUMNS ADDED:
- content_type (VARCHAR NOT NULL) - Critical for scheduler
- platform (VARCHAR NOT NULL) - Publishing platform
- status (VARCHAR NOT NULL) - Content status
- scheduled_at (TIMESTAMP) - Schedule time
- Plus 14 additional optional columns

INDEXES CREATED:
- idx_content_status
- idx_content_scheduled_at
- idx_content_user_id
- idx_content_project_id
- idx_content_platform
- idx_content_content_type
- idx_content_scheduler_query (composite)

TESTING:
✅ Schema validation logic added
✅ Verification script created
✅ Idempotent operations ensure safety
✅ Clear error messages with fix instructions

DEPLOYMENT:
Migration will run automatically on Railway deployment.
Alternative: Run fix-scheduler-schema-permanent.cjs directly.

IMPACT:
- Fixes critical application startup failure
- Enables scheduler service to initialize
- Restores content scheduling functionality
- Prevents future schema drift issues

DOCUMENTATION:
- SCHEDULER_SCHEMA_FIX_COMPLETE.md (full technical docs)
- DEPLOY_SCHEDULER_FIX_NOW.md (quick deployment guide)
- SCHEDULER_SCHEMA_PERMANENT_FIX_SUMMARY.md (executive summary)
- QUICK_FIX_SCHEDULER_SCHEMA.md (quick reference)
